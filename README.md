# FF9-Console-Battle

This is my toy project which hopes to replicate battle system in Final Fantasy 9. I don't need yet any fancy graphics (which I don't know how to do honestly). Currently UI is in terminal. Most on the thigns which I'm doing, expect UI, is backed by tests.

## Currently implemented

- Attacks and damage rolls
- Turn based combat (not ATB)
- Action result panel which informs players about result of an action
- Player and enemy party up to 4 units

## Work in progress

- Defence stance (now, it is flat 50% damage reduction)
- Stealing system
- Targeting panel which allows player to select a target of an action
- Party status panel which allows to see unit name, hp and mp
- AI taking turns (now, AI can use only physical attacks against player unit)

## Not implemented

- Shit ton of things
